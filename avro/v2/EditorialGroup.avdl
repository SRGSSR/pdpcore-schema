     * Show: A show is a format that serves as a framework for a series of programmes or episodes produced in a
     * particular style or on a particular theme. Each show may have regularly recurring segments,
     * a fixed time slot and a specific target audience. An example of this is the main news programme
     * on Swiss Radio and Television (SRF), the "Tagesschau".
     * Collection: The collection represents a grouping of some kind, e.g. a topic
     * or category. A grouping can have other groupings as its members when
     * representing a hirarchical structure.
     * Series: A series is a special type of editorial group that consists of several episodes.
     * It is grouped according to characters, themes or a publication scheme and can contain both continuous
     * stories and stand-alone episodes. Series differ from shows in their specific structure and thematic
     * or narrative continuity.
